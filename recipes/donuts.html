        <h3> Ingredents </h3>
        <h4>Donuts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (gives them that “bakery donut” taste)</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1/3 cup (65g) packed light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup (60ml) milk*</li>
                <li>1/4 cup (60g) Greek yogurt*</li>
                <li>2 Tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
       <h4>Chocolate Glaze</h4>
       <ul>
           <li>1/2 cup (90g) semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
           <li>2 Tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter</li>
           <li>2 teaspoons light corn syrup</li>
           <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
           <li>rainbow sprinkles</li>
       </ul>
       <h4>Instructions</h4>
       <ol>
           <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Spray a donut pan with non-stick spray. Set aside.</li>
           <li>Make the donuts: Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and nutmeg together in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>
           <li>Whisk the egg, brown sugar, milk, and yogurt together until smooth. Add the melted butter and vanilla, whisking until fully combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix. The batter will be very thick.</li>
           <li>Spoon the batter into the donut cavities—I highly recommend using a large zipped-top bag for ease, as pictured and explained in detail above. Cut a corner off the bottom of the bag and pipe the batter into each donut cup, filling 2/3 to 3/4 of the way full.</li>
           <li>Bake for 9-10 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove from the pan and bake the remaining donut batter. Allow the donuts to slightly cool before glazing.</li>
           <li>Make the chocolate glaze: Place the chocolate chips, butter, corn syrup, and water in a medium bowl. Melt in 20 second increments in the microwave, stirring after each time, until completely melted and smooth. Dip the tops of the donuts into the chocolate glaze and then cover with sprinkles. I simply poured the sprinkles into a deep bowl and dipped the tops of the donuts into it. You’ll likely have leftover glaze. It’s great on ice cream!</li>
           <li>Donuts taste best eaten the same day, though they may be covered tightly and stored at room temperature for 2 days.</li>
       </ol>
